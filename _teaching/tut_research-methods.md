In the Empirical Research Methods course, taught by Prof. Dr. Susumu Shikano, students explore essential empirical social science techniques vital for theory testing and systematic data collection and analysis. As a tutor for this course during the years 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, I supported students by clarifying complex concepts, guiding them through practical applications of empirical methods, and preparing them for the written exam. Additionally, I designed worksheets to reinforce lecture material and provide hands-on practice.
