In the Statistics course, taught by Prof. Dr. Termeh Shafie, students learn the foundation of regression analysis, implement it using data and generate and test hypotheses in quantitative research. As the head tutor for this course, I supported students by clarifying complex statistical concepts, guiding them through practical applications of regression analysis, and preparing them for the written exam. Additionally, I designed worksheets to reinforce lecture material and coordinated workflows and collaboration among the tutors.
