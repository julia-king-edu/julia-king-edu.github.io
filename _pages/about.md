Welcome
====

Welcome to my personal website! I am a final year graduate student studying within the M.Sc. Social and Economic Data Science program at the University of Konstanz. With a profound interest in network analysis and a passion for working with social media data, my research aims to uncover the complex patterns and interactions that shape our digital world. My academic journey has equipped me with a robust foundation in computer science, statistics, and social science methods, enabling me to extract meaningful insights from large datasets to inform decision-making processes in both academic and practical contexts.

The interdisciplinary nature of my program at Konstanz has allowed me to collaborate with experts across Political Science, Economics, and Computer Science, broadening my theoretical and methodological perspectives. This unique approach has not only enhanced my technical skills but also prepared me for a rapidly growing job market in data science. As I aspire to pursue a PhD, I am eager to contribute to advancing the field through innovative research and analysis. Please explore my website to learn more about my publications, teaching, and professional experiences, and feel free to reach out for collaboration or further discussion on my work.
